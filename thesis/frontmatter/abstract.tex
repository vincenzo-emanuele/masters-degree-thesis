    This research study investigates the correlation between Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and the detection of cyberattacks in data centers. The aim of this study is to explore how fluctuations in PUE values may affect the detection of cyberattacks, considering the potential impact on both energy efficiency and security. By analyzing real-world data and simulating two attack scenarios, namely a Denial of Service Attack and a cooling system attack, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between PUE and attack detection.% \\[1cm]
