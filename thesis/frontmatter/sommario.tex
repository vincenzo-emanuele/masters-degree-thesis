    This research study investigates the correlation between Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in data centers. PUE is a metric used to measure data center energy efficiency, while DDoS attacks pose significant security threats. The aim of this study is to explore how fluctuations in PUE values may affect the detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks, considering the potential impact on both energy efficiency and security. By analyzing real-world data and employing statistical analysis techniques, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between PUE and DDoS attack detection.
