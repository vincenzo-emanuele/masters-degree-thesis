The aim of this research study is to investigate how fluctuations in Power Usage Effectiveness \emph{PUE} values may help in the detection of cyberattacks, considering the potential impact on Data Centers security. By analyzing real-world data gathered through a specific simulation tool and modeling two attack scenarios, namely a Denial of Service (\emph{DoS}) attack and a cooling system attack, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between \emph{PUE} variation and attacks detection, determining whether the implementation of a detection algorithm based on \emph{PUE} monitoring is feasible.% \\[1cm]
